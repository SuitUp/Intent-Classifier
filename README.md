# Intent-Classifier

A Multi-Label Intent Classifier for a chatbot application.

This is an example repo for the Intent Classification project I did.

The Notebook was created in the "Google Colab" setup.

When running the Cells at the intial steps you will be asked to upload the dataset. Please do so.

I have tried my best to make the code easy to iterate and understand.

Also, I have given my best efforts to make the comments where ever I possibly could. The notebook has Key ideas, important observations, and references section.
