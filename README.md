# Intent-Classifier

A Multi-Label Intent Classifier for a given real world raw data-set.

The Notebook is named "Intent_Classifier_final.ipynb".

The Notebook was created in the "Google Colab" setup.

To execute the notebook successfully in the jupyter environment it is suggested to have the dataset,
that is "TakeHome_task_data.scv" file in the same path as the Jupyter Notebook.

When running the Cells at the intial steps you will be asked to upload the dataset. Please do so.

The Pre-Processed csv file is not created externally, but instead it is created inside the Notebook only and is 
well understandable.

I have tried my best to make the code easy to iterate and understand.

Also, I have given my best efforts to make the comments where ever I possibly could.
